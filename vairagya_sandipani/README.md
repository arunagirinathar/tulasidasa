Vairagya Sandipani
======

Vairagya Sandipani is a poetically, philosophically and intellectually mature work of Srimad Goswami Tulasidasa-the saint poet of North India having no parallel in the world. It was perhaps one of the last chapters of his life and works. As the very name indicates, it kindles or promotes—atleast indentes to do so—dispassion and de- votion. It is on the pattern of Tirukkural of Tiruvalluvar or Vairagya Shatakam or Bhartrihari. A small booklet con- taining a few Dohas and Chaupais, approximately fifty, so to say, but the ideas contained therein, are grand and irrefutable as he lived and breathed in dispassion from the world and strong attachment to his R̄ama. I expect that the readers will find it a very good guide and a guard against the undue worldly allurements. It is not only worth reading but translating too into life.
